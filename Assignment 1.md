## Variable declaration in swift

Variable declared using let and var keywords, key difference between them is that let is immutable (constant) and var is mutable. 
```
let pi = 3.14159
var radius: Double = 5.0
print("pi is \(pi)")
```
pi is implicitly inferred as double with a value of 3.14159.
radius is explicitly declared as a variable with a value of 5.0.
To view the data type of variable, hold option and click on the variable name.
Once a type is declared/inferred, it cannot be changed. It will result in a compile-time error if you try to change it. once a bool always a boolean value.
We can declare a variable without value by defining it's type. (Double, string etc)

## Printing values

Use \() to print value of Variables. It's known as string interpolation. You can evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and print the result. \(2+3)
