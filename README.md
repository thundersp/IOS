Swift is a general-purpose programming language developed by Apple Inc. It is designed to work with Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems, as well as with other platforms such as watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is known for its safety, performance, and ease of use, and is widely used in the development of mobile and desktop applications.
Swift is designed to be clean, expressive and easy to read. It is a strongly, statically typed language. Data types mismatch is not allowed. It is fast due to LLVM compiler, performance comparable to C++. Swift is type safe. Swift is also memory safe, thanks to its automatic memory management system. It is open source. Supports both OOP and functional programming paradigms.
Swift uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) for memory management. ARC automatically manages memory by keeping track of the number of references to an object and deallocating it when it is no longer needed.
